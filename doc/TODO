[D] Bring in stuff similar to haproxy/include/common/compiler.h and "kernel tricks"
[ ] Quick error standardization / macros
[ ] GCC optimization using cpuinfo etc. (in fact, make it generalized so I can
    use it in different projects...)
[ ] Do quick darwin implementation of file_to_pipe
[ ] On to the meat...
