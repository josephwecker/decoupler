 Decoupler
-----------

Similar to a named pipe, but buffered, optimized for kernel-space-only data
transfers in and out. Backed by a file.


Compiling / Installing
----------------------

The following should do the trick:

  $  ./waf configure build install

See `./waf --help` for more options.


Usage
------------

Still getting nailed down- see doc/notes.md for recent thoughts on how it's shaping up.
